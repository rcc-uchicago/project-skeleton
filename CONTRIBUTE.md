# Contributing Guidelines

The project lead assumes ownership of the repo and reviews all contributions from project collaborators.

Please use the [fork & pull][fork-and-pull] workflow when contributing:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.

When making a pull request, please explain why you’re making a change. Even if it
seems self-evident, please take a sentence or two to tell us why your change or
addition should happen.

The fork & pull model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.
